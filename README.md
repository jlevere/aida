# 間 — Aida

A focused Japanese kana typing trainer.

One character at a time. Type the reading. Correct answers advance silently. Mistakes return sooner.

Spacing adapts using [FSRS](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/ts-fsrs). Characters you know well appear less. Weak ones come back. Everything runs in the browser, stored locally, no account needed.
